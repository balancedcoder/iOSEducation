This repository contains all projects I have created for educational purposes. Below is a list of the projects, with a short description of what I learned building the project. 

## I Am Rich App:
###     iOS11 App Development Bootcamp, App 1 

This application is based off of the I Am Rich application that Armin Heinrich created in 2008. The purpose of this applicaiton was for people who are rich to buy this app as a status symbol. The app sold around 8 copies for $999.99. 

#### What was learned in this application: 
        1. Basics of Xcode IDE. 
        2. Placing UI elements onto Main.storyboard 
        3. Storing and Organizing Image Assests
